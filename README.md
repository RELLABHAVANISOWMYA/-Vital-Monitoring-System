### ⚙️ **Core Features**
1. **📊 Health Data Validation:**
   - Capture essential health data such as:
     - 🔢 **Age** & 🧍 **Gender**
     - ❤️ **Heart Rate**
     - 🩸 **Blood Pressure**
     - 🌡️ **Body Temperature**
   - Ensure inputs are correctly formatted and valid using live validation feedback.

2. **🔄 Interactive Slides:**
   - Guided step-by-step input through multiple screens.
   - Dynamic slide transitions for smooth user experience.

3. **🧠 Smart Analysis:**
   - Compares user data against scientifically validated normal ranges:
     - **Heart Rate Range:** `60-100 bpm`
     - **Blood Pressure Ranges** (Age-Specific)
     - **Temperature Ranges:** Celsius (`35-37°C`) / Fahrenheit (`96-99°F`)
   - Provides instant feedback:
     - ✅ "All metrics are normal!"
     - ⚠️ Warnings for abnormalities.

4. **📝 Recommendations:**
   - Generates a list of recommended tests if abnormalities are detected:
     - Example: *Electrocardiogram (ECG)* for irregular heart rate.

5. **🔙 Navigation:**
   - Easy transitions with "Back" and "Next" buttons.
   - Seamless navigation to revisit or adjust input values.
